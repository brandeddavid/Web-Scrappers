Corporate Buzz Words,http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/word-lists/corporate-buzz-words.html,"Buzz Word: Empowerment
One of the corporate words that has filtered out into the larger society is “empowerment.” It would seem to have a precise meaning, but that often isn’t the case.
By its very nature, the opportunities for true worker empowerment, or the ability to fashion their own workplace, is obviously limited. It involves replacing the traditional boss-worker structure with self-managed groups. The worker then becomes the subject of his peers, so the chances of any true individual empowerment are very limited.
Buzz Word: Leverage
In the past few decades, leveraged buyouts have become the stuff of legend. Many people have lost money in such transactions, but the word “leverage” has enter the general language.
The actual genesis of the word “leverage” harkens back to the days of ironworkers and carpenters. If you wanted to move a heavy object, you’d use a lever as a wedge under it. Now you can use language as the wedge to “leverage” the meaning of your words.
Now people speak of leveraging their relationships, their children’s futures, and even their own lives. A financial term has been expanded to include many things that haven’t a thing to do with business.
Buzz Word: Ballpark
Another common word you’ll hear everywhere is “ballpark.” Is an estimate in the ballpark? How many people showed up at the picnic? What’s the ballpark on it?
Buzz Word: Bottom line
The “bottom line” used to be an accounting practice. Now it means the final result, after everything is said and done.
Suppose you go out to dinner and order a steak, dessert, and several glasses of wine. What’s the total cost of your meal? Or you could say “what’s the bottom line?” and your waiter would know exactly what you meant.
Buzz Word: Incentivize
You have to keep your ear to the ground to be kept in the loop. If you want cooperation, you have to ""incentivize"" your efforts so your pals will do as you want.
Buzz Word: Technology
Another huge buzz word is one that is practically inescapable, and that word is “technology.” It used to be what scientists devised and businesses sold. Now it’s gone out from the assembly line into the language so that practically everything is “technology-based.”
Want to sell people stuff they don’t need? How about if you just invented the latest face cream to stave off aging? Just fit the word “technology” into your advertising, and watch sales skyrocket!
The sheen of the word “technology” seems to be enough to draw customers. It’s also hugely helpful if the company selling the product doesn’t make a huge issue of the specifics of how and why this product will make you look 20 years younger.
It’s “technology,” isn’t it? The word has almost assumed the power of being its own religion. This is just one more example of the buzz words with which the language is inundated.
Buzz Word: Prioritize
Buzz Word: Itemize
Buzz Word: Proactive
Buzz Word: Putting Them to Bed
Are you making a list and checking it twice? You have to prioritize and itemize, and then become proactive in ticking the items off the list, or in corporatese, “putting them to bed.""
Buzz Word: Push the Envelope
Buzz Word: Paradigm Shift
Just try to “push the envelope” without causing a “paradigm shift.” It’s next to impossible!
Buzz Word: Results Driven
Buzz Word: Synergy
If you think the ends justifies the means, you might be a “results driven” executive of a big company. If you desire “synergy” among your staff, don’t consult a dictionary. The original derivation of the word is a contraction of “synthetic” and “energy”!
Buzz Word: Straw Men
Blame the “straw men” for this surge of corporate buzz words. They don’t exist, just as much meaning doesn’t exist in these word crutches that often are an impediment to clear thought and precise language.

If everything is coming your way, youre in the wrong lane!
Hes so rich; he buys a new boat each time one gets wet.
He was as mad as a mule chewing on bumblebees!
I think hes one fry short of a Happy Meal.
You look about as happy as a tick on a fat dog.

The Predator flies at 26,000 feet and can stay aloft for 24 hours.
Cluster bombs Highly controversial weapons dropped from the air. They consist of a canister containing a large number of submunitions or bomblets. The bomblets can be anti-personnel, anti-tank, dual-purpose or incendiary. They stay on the ground and explode under pressure like landmines. Human rights groups want them banned; the military sees them as very useful in certain circumstances.
Dumb bombs Sometimes called ""iron bombs"" traditional freefall bombs. The LANTIRN system can be used as a targeting mechanism on dumb bombs. These bombs are primarily used against military formations that are in the open.
Fuel-air bombs Vaporize a fuel in the air, then ignite it, producing a fireball and rapidly expanding blast wave many times greater than the explosion from conventional bombs. The explosion creates a vacuum; thus, these bombs are like small nuclear weapons, without the radiation. Useful against targets such as bunkers and caves, where the aerosol cloud can penetrate and the confined space magnifies the blast.
Aircraft carrier  An aircraft carrier heads up a carrier battle group. On board the carriers are typically 70-80 planes for defense, attack, refuelling in flight, jamming enemy communications and radars, and for airborne surveillance and control.
Carrier Battle Group A group of ships and aircraft deployed for battle. For example, the USS Theodore Roosevelt is the carrier at the head of a battle group involved in the attacks against the Taliban. Included in the Theodore Roosevelt's complement are two attack submarines, the USS Hartford and USS Springfield, which can fire Tomahawk cruise missiles and 2100 Marines aboard a group of vessels led by the assault ship USS Bataan. The troop of 2100 soldiers comes with supporting artillery, amphibious assault vehicles and light armor, plus transport and attack helicopters and AV-8B Harrier II ""jump jets,"" capable of taking off and landing vertically. USS Carl Vinson An aircraft carrier heading up a battle group in the Persian Gulf. Mailing address: USS CARL VINSON (CVN 70) FPO AP 96629-2840
USS Enterprise An aircraft carrier heading up a battle group in the Arabian Sea.
USS Kitty Hawk The only US aircraft carrier stationed in the western Pacific, the Kitty Hawk has reportedly left its full complement of fighter jets behind and will be used as a landing pad for helicopters involved in the attack on the Taliban.
USS Theodore Roosevelt  Aircraft carrier at the head of the battle group involved in the strikes against the Taliban. Included in its complement are two attack submarines, the USS Hartford and USS Springfield, which can fire Tomahawk cruise missiles. The group includes 2100 Marines aboard a group of vessels led by the assault ship USS Bataan. The group includes group troops with supporting artillery, amphibious assault vehicles and light armor, plus transport and attack helicopters and AV-8B Harrier ""jump jets,"" capable of taking off and landing vertically.
AGM-84 Harpoon Standoff land attack missile (SLAM) with a range of about 60 miles. Has accuracy of within 52 feet; a ""smart"" bomb that uses a global positioning system.
AGM-86 Cruise An air-launched cruise missile made by Boeing. Has a range of 1550 miles and a speed of 550 mph, propelled by a turbofan jet engine. The AGM-86 flies at low altitudes and relies on its global positioning system to seek targets. It is launched from the B-52H and B-1B.
AGM-88 HARM The AGM-88 HARM (high-speed antiradiation missile) is an air-to-surface anti-radiation missile designed to destroy radar-equipped air defense systems. The proportional guidance system hones in on enemy radar emissions. The F-16C can carry and launch the AGM-88, and is the only aircraft currently equipped with AGM-88.
AIM-9 Sidewinder An infrared air-to-air missile that homes onto the heat of a target aircraft and can operate independently of radar. Used in a dog-fighting capacity.
Air-to-ground missiles Can have either a TV camera or infrared imaging device in their nose for guidance. This lets the attack crew see the target from the weapon's point of view. They can lock onto the target or, in some types, steer the rocket-powered missiles onto it. Some types of missiles allow one plane to fire and another to guide.
Ballistic missile A guided rocket-powered delivery vehicle for use against ground targets. A large portion of its flight is in a ballistic (freefall) trajectory. Ballistic missiles are an optimal delivery systems for weapons of mass destruction because it is difficult to deter them.
Cruise missile A generic name for any self-propelled, guided missile that flies at a moderate speed and at a low altitude, following the terrain beneath it. They are a staple of armaments because they are cheap (approximately $600,000 remember, we're talking the military budget), simple to build and can be launched in large numbers from sea, land or air. The Tomahawk is a cruise missile.
Digital Scene Matching Area Correlation (DSMAC) DSMAC compares what it can see on the cruise missile's approach to its target with a digital rendition of that target that the missile carries in its memory. DSMAC is dependent on intelligence to provide it with up-to-date information about target buildings and civilian shelters.
GBU-28 A 5000-pound laser-guided weapon that can travel more than 5 nautical miles and penetrate earth and rock up to 22 feet before exploding.
Global Positioning System Uses a global network of satellites to provide accurate navigational information for sailors, hill walkers, drivers and missiles. The weapon is programmed with the target location and can steer itself towards it by constant reference to the satellites.
JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munition) JDAM is a global positioning system kit that converts freefalling conventional bombs into ""smart"" ones with a targeting and guidance mechanism.
Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) A new air-to-ground smart bomb with a 15-50 mile range. It uses global positioning to seek targets and is used to attack targets from outside enemy air defenses.
Laser-guidance system Laser-guided bombs have a seeker in their nose which tracks a laser beam trained on the target by the aircraft dropping the bomb, another aircraft, or forces on the ground.
Terrain Contour Matching (TERCOM) The heart of the cruise missile. TERCOM allows the weapon to ""read"" the ground over which it flies. The missile itself carries a 3-D map of its route. TERCOM compares a picture of the ground to the map in its memory and adjusts its course as needed. This minimizes radar detection.
Raytheon BGM-109 Tomahawk Cruise missile The missile of choice for U.S. forces and the British Royal Navy. A land-attack cruise missile that can travel around 1000 miles. It uses TERCOM and DSMAC intelligence to reach and hit targets and can be launched from ships or submarine torpedo tubes.
82nd Airborne Division (U.S.) Although not designated a special forces outfit, the 82nd is usually the first U.S. troops to touch ground in a conflict. They were the first to touch ground in Kosovo, the major force in ousting Norega in Panama and, only 7 months later, the first outfit in Saudi Arabia as the Gulf War began. In 1992 these tough guys spent a month in Southern Florida, just ravaged by hurrican Andrew, providing food, shelter and medical attention to a grateful people in that state.
Air Force Special Operations Forces (U.S.) The Air Force Special Ops Forces provide transport and close-air support as part of any special ops mission. Close-air support means that they fire on targets, participate in refueling, resupplying and other support tasks.
Army Rangers (U.S.) Spearhead of the Army's special operations forces. They are ready to go by land, air and sea, anywhere, at a moment's notice. The Rangers specialize in rapid infantry assault, night fighting and airfield seizure. They are supported by the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, better known as ""Night Stalkers,"" which use state-of-the-art aircraft and equipment to assist all special ops forces.
Delta Force (U.S.) Delta Force is one of the U.S. military's elite special ops units, drawing members from all military branches. Modeled on the British SAS. The composition, strength and abilities of Delta Force are a secret, as are all of its missions. Their training, however, focuses on counter-terrorism and hostage rescue.
Green Berets (U.S.) The real name of the Green Berets is ""U.S. Army Special Forces (Airborne)."" The name ""Green Berets"" comes from the most distinctive part of their uniform, of course. The Green Berets appear in a variety of missions, including unconventional warfare, special reconnaissance, direct action and counter-terrorism. They also train guerilla troops in other countries; therefore, each member must be able to speak at least one language other than English. (Do any Green Berets use YDC's resources for language study? We can neither confirm nor deny that.)
The Royal Gurkha Rifles (U.K.) The Gurkhas, a British special ops unit that has existed since 1815, has historically been known for its ferocity and military ability. Today there are 3400 troops.
Marine Expeditionary Units(U.S.) Not technically a special ops force, the Expeditionary Units are ""special ops capable."" They're quite capable of quick, compact, multifaceted military campaigns. These units have more equipment, logistical and technical support, weaponry and soldiers than their conventional Marine counterparts, all to the purpose of providing the commander-in-chief with operational maneuver capability from the sea. Each Expeditionary Unit includes 2200 personnel. The infantry battalion uses amphibious assault and light-armored vehicles; the aviation unit employs helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft such as Harrier jets.
Navy SEALs (U.S.) SEAL stands for Sea, Air, Land, and the SEALs are the U.S. Navy's most acclaimed special ops unit. They operate mainly in 16-man groups and are capable of conducting top-secret ground- and water-based missions. Larger teams are often divided into ""cells"" to work at evasion and recovery, force protection, sniper duties, and so forth.
Royal Marines (U.K.) The Royal Marines are the British Navy's infantry brigade. They're employed mainly for amphibious operations or from airplanes and retain a commando unit in constant readiness to deploy worldwide on short notice.
Parachute Regiment (U.K.) A British Army regiment, the Paras comprise four battalions. One is in a constant state of readiness, while the Pathfinder Platoon conducts reconnaissance and advance missions before any airborne assaults.
Special Air Service (U.K.) The most well-known of British special ops units, the SAS lives by the motto ""Who Dares Wins."" The SAS is a regiment of the British Army, specializing in counter-terrorism operations.

Glossary of Biochem Terrorism,http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/glossaries/global-counterrorism/bioterrorism.html,"agroterrorism
Terrorist attacks aimed at reducing the food supply by destroying crops using natural pests such as the potato beetle, animal diseases such as hoof and mouth disease and anthrax, molds and other plant diseases, or chemicals that defoliate vegetation, such as Agent Orange, used in Vietnam.  
 
anthrax
An infectious and often fatal disease contracted from animals. Cutaneous anthrax is contracted through a break in the skin. Infection spreads through the bloodstream causing shock, cyanosis, sweating, and collapse. Inhalation anthrax is contracted by breathing in anthrax spores, resulting in pneumonia, sometimes accompanied by meningitis, followed by death. Because its spores have a long survival period, the incubation period is short, and the disability severe, anthrax has long been developed as a biological weapon by several nations.  
 
antiballistic missile
A missile for intercepting and destroying ballistic missiles.
 
ballistic missile
A guided rocket-powered delivery vehicle for use against ground targets. A large portion of its flight in a ballistic (freefall) trajectory. Ballistic missiles are an optimal delivery systems for weapons of mass destruction because it is difficult to deter them.
 
Biological Weapons Convention (BWC)
Officially, the ""Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction"" (Biological Weapons Convention or BWC). It was opened for signature by the United Nations on April 10, 1972 and went into force in 1975 but no formal verification procedure was established. Since 1991 an ad hoc group of signatory states has been developing a rolling text of a verification protocol to the Convention.  
 
bioterrorism
The use of biological agents such as bacteria and viruses in a terrorist operation. The most likely biological toxins terrorists might adopt are anthrax, salmonella, e. coli, hoof-and-mouth disease, the plague, smallpox, botulism, and tularemia.
 
biochemterrorism
Terrorism that resorts to biological or chemical agents as weapons.
 
blister agents
These agents cause incapacitation rather than death. These are unlikely agents to be used by terrorists but they might be used to to injure many people and overload regional medical facilities. Lewisite or mustard gas are the best known of these.  
 
blood agents
Blood agents are based on cyanide compounds. Hydrogen cyanide (AC) is a blood agent slightly more lethal than phosgen. Its rapid rate of evaporation makes it less a candidate for mass terrorism than for assassination.  
 
botulism
The botulinum toxin is extremely lethal and easy to produce. A small quantity of this toxin can destroy the central nervous system. Botulism may be contracted by eating contaminated foods or by absorbing the bacteria through cuts in the skin. Fewer than 200 cases reported annually in the U.S. Intentional contamination of the food supply or aerosol dissemination of the toxin is the greatest concern of counterterrorists.  
 
chemterrorism
The use of chemical agents in a terrorist operation. The most worrisome chemical is the nerve gas, sarin, used in the Tokyo subway attack that killed 12 but injured thousands. Chemical agents are far easier to store and transport safely. The most likely to be used are blister agents, choking agents, nerve agents, and cyanide based compounds.
 
choking agent
The chemical agents preferred in WW I have lost much of their destructive utility since the invention of nerve agents. Choking agents are lethal and are very easily obtained. Phosgene is a common industrial chemical that serves as a moderately lethal choking agent.
 
cruise missile
A guided missile that flies at a moderate speed and at a low altitude, following the terrain beneath it. The ""Tomahawk"" is a cruise missile.  
 
cyanide agents
Hydrogen cyanide reportedly was used by Iraq in the war against Iran and against the Kurds in northern Iraq during the 1980's. The Nazis used a form of hydrogen cyanide (Zyklon B) the gas chambers of their concentration camps. It colorless liquid which may be inhaled in gaseous form. Cyanide salts and liquid cyanide may be absorbed by the skin. Symptoms are dizziness, headache, palpitations and respiratory difficulty. These are later followed by vomiting, convulsions, respiratory failure, unconsciousness, and death.  
 
e-bomb
An electromagnetic bomb that produces a high-power flash of radio waves or microwaves that destroys any delicate electronic circuitry it hits. It causes mass disruption without destroying life or property. An e-bomb could freeze transportation systems, wreck communication systems, and destroy computer networks. The U.S. will begin production next year on a sophisticated version but the cost to a terrorist for an e-bomb with no bells or whistles: an estimated $400.  
 
hesperophobia
Fear of the west
 
Information Warfare (IW) 
  Warfare against the information systems of an enemy with or without destroying large physical assets, such as buildings. IW without destruction of large physical assets has the advantage of rapid reconstruction after the war. E-bombs would be a valuable asset in a targeted IW.
 
ICBM
Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. Ballistic missiles have no guidance system but are dependent upon their ballistic trajectory. ICBM's have long ranges (from one continent to another) but are expensive. However, it is possible to equip them with multiple warheads, each of which is guided to different target. Four potentially hostile Third World countries are currently developing ICBM programs: Iraq, Iran, Libya, and North Korea.
 
Iraq
Iraq launched 96 of its ballistic missiles, ""Al Hussein,"" in the Gulf War. It is a modified Russian SCUD-B (surface-surface) missile with a range of about 650 km. Iraq has produced at least 80 ""special warheads"" for its Al Hussein missiles, 50 for chemical weapons, 25 for biological weapons, and 5 for trials. Sanctions were placed on Iraq after the Gulf War by the U.N. until it dismantled its biological and chemical weapons but the U.N. observation team left the country before confirming compliance after a long series of delaying tactics by president Sadam Hussein.  
 
mustard gas
Mustard agents are blistering agents because the wounds caused by these substances resemble burns and blisters. Mustard agents cause severe damage to the eyes, respiratory system and internal organs. Mustard agent was produced for the first time in 1822 but its harmful effects were not discovered until 1860. Mustard agent was first used as a chemical warfare agent during WWI. Victims suffered lung and eye injuries and pain 30-40 years after exposure.
 
nerve agent
The original nerve agents were insecticides developed into chemical weapons by the Nazi military during World War II. Now sarin, tabun, soman, and a few others are the major chemical weapons currently stockpiled in several nations (including the U.S.) They are hundreds to thousands of times more lethal than blister, choking, and blood agents. These chemicals are the most useful to terrorists because of the small quantity needed to inflict a substantial amount of damage.
 
P5
The permanent five members of the UN Security Council: China, England, France, Russia, and the U.S.A.  
 
Pakistan
Pakistan began its ballistic missile program with Chinese help and expertise, but is now developing its own program. It currently owns around 120 ballistic missiles, some of which are capable of hitting anywhere in India, and is working on missiles with longer ranges.  
 
The Plague
The pneumonic plague (more likely to be used by terrorists than bubonic) results in fever, shortness of breath, coughing with bloody sputum. It can lead to septic shock and death. This disease is usually carried by rodents and fleas, but can be aerosolized and sprayed from crop dusters.  
 
pathogen
Any agent or organism that can cause disease.  
 
proliferation
The spread of biochemical, nuclear, and other weapons of mass destruction to countries not originally involved in developing them. ""Primary proliferators"" are the leading industrial nations like the U.S., France, Great Britain, Russia, who originally develop nuclear weapons and biological and chemical warfare agents. ""Secondary proliferators"" are those countries that have developed indigenous programs and that now may or do sell their innovations to other countries or terrorist organizations. The U. S. government think these include China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Russia, and Syria.  
 
salmonella
The symptoms of salmonella enteritis include muscle and abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and fever. The symptoms usually are not fatal but dehydration resulting from the diarrhea is a complicating factor, and the disease could lead to meningitis or septicemia. Salmonella enteritis is the result of ingestion of contaminated food or water. The incubation period is 8 to 48 hours after exposure, and the acute illness lasts for 1 to 2 weeks.  
 
sarin
A colorless, odorless gas with a lethal dose of 0.5 milligram. It is 26 times more deadly than cyanide gas and is 20 times more lethal than potassium cyanide. A pinprick sized droplet will kill an adult. The vapor is slightly heavier than air, so it hovers close to the ground. Under wet and humid weather conditions sarin degrades swiftly, but as the temperature rises, sarin’s life-expectancy increases regardless of humidity.
 
smallpox
The first infectious disease afflicting humans ever globally eradicated. Smallpox killed 300 million people in the 19th century. Human beings as a whole are extraordinarily susceptible to infection by smallpox right now, precisely because it has been eradicated. Within 48 hours, smallpox could travel from New York to Italy to Baghdad.  
 
Syria
Syria has one of the largest ballistic missile arsenals in the Third World and the Pentagon believes that Syria has chemical warheads available for a portion of its SCUD missile force. It acquired its arsenal from Iran, Russia, China and, primarily, North Korea.
 
tularemia
A highly infections disease with symptoms that include a high fever, pneumonia, pleuritis. it can cause respiratory failure and death. Because it is highly infectious, it is a possible terrorist bacteriological agent.
 
weapons of mass destruction
Any weapon, nuclear, biological, or chemical, that can kills large numbers of people. There are three types of delivery system usually considered for WMD— ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and combat aircraft.

Glossary of Cultural Anthropology,http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/glossaries/glossary-of-cultural-anthropology.html,"Informal negative sanction: An unofficial, non-governmental punishment for violations of social norms. Informal negative sanctions usually are in the form of gossip, public ridicule, social ostracism, insults, or even threats of physical harm by other members of the community.
Levels of political integration: A term referring to general types of political systems to organize and manage societies.
Politics: Competition for power over people and things.
Raiding: Surprise predatory attacks against other communities or societies.
Acephalous society: A society in which political power is diffused to the degree that there are no institutionalized political leadership roles such as chiefs and kings.
Parallel cousin: One's father's brother's children or mother's sister's children. The gender of the children is not relevant in making this distinction.
Collateral relative: Uncles, aunts, cousins, nephews, nieces and other consanguinal kinsmen beyond ego's main line of descent.
Consanguinity: a socially recognized biological descent link, such as between a woman and her father, aunt, or daughter. Individuals who have a consanguinity relationship are ""consanguines""to each other.  Consanguinity literally means ""with the blood,"" reflecting the old incorrect assumption that biological inheritance is passed on through blood rather than DNA.
Grammar: The part of language analysis that is concerned with how the sounds are used to make sense.
Informal education: Learning as a result of imitation, experimentation, and repetitive practice of basic skills. This is what happens when children role-play adult interactions in their games.
Non market economy: An economy with a low level of technological knowledge and a preoccupation with the daily, and at most, seasonal food supply because techniques for long term preservation of food are generally inadequate.

Potlatch: A complex redistributive system that existed among some of the Indian cultures of the northwest coast of North America.
Actual behavior: What people really do in their lives rather than what they think they are doing or what they believe they should be doing. In most societies, there is a discrepancy between these three different sorts of behaviors.
Cultural universals: Cultural traits that are shared by all of humanity collectively.
Cyclical round of migrations: Seasonal migrations of foragers or pastoralists between different environments in their territories. This often involves migrations that take people from spring to summer camps and then to fall ones and then to winter ones.
Manifest functions: Functions that are obvious and easily discovered even by strangers to a place.
