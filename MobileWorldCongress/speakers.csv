Alison,Wedgwood,eWATERpay Ltd,CEO,"I am the CEO of eWATERpay Ltd  a UK tech start up revolutionising the delivery of water in rural sub-Saharan Africa. I have put in £500,000 of my own money and we have raised £350,000 of Angel funding, and are now looking to initiate a Series A fund round. Recently we have been advised by a Senior partner at Deloittes, and our new COO was, until three weeks ago the Commander of the UK Navy Maritime Fleet, Rear Admiral Alex Burton.

eWater (http://www.ewaterpay.com/), recently featured on the BBC news (click for link to video) and in the Economist (click for link to article), has also recently won the RELX Group Environmental Sustainability Prize 2017 which was presented in Stockholm at the UN CEO Water Mandate conference at World Water Week (click for link to article).

eWATERpay  is a pre-payment smart meter that can be fitted onto taps on any piped water systems in rural or urban areas of developing countries. It allows very low income households to pay affordable sums for water through loading their smart cards with eWATERcredit.   The unique combination of three technologies integrating mobile and contactless pay technology,  and IOT connectivity  ensures the transparent collection of consumers’ water fees to fund the maintenance of water systems. Currently, $20 billion is invested in new water supply infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa per annum, but within three years, 40% of these systems are broken because there is no funded maintenance. eWATERpay solves this problem by ensuring  revenue is tracked and accountable and transparently used by water Ministries, or private water utilities, to pay for continued maintenance.  

The technology is proven and currently operating in the most remote, fragile communities, supported by eWaterCare live cloud reporting, which allows 100% tracking of revenue, flow rates and usage. This functionality and data generation provides water practitioners with an intuitive data dashboard sending out automated alerts to enable full management of O&M. The team has achieved installation of more than 100 taps in Tanzania and Gambia serving more than 20,000 people in 9 villages. It has a contract for a further five villages in Tanzania, several more contracts in the pipeline and a significant volume of expressions of interest. eWaterPay is ready to go to scale, guarantee truly sustainable clean water for 3 million people by 2020 and offer very credible returns for an investor.

eWATERpay encourages a private, efficient water market to emerge serving the 1 billion people that do not have access to reliable, affordable water.  We have proven to utilities that having a low cost pre-payment tap improves revenue collection by 341%, reduces water waste, increases access to water from 4 hours to 24 hours per day,  reduces the time taken to fetch water from 3 hours to 10 minutes,  and reduces repair times from 2 weeks to 5 hours.

We are seeking  an equity investor to help us to  scale our business and accelerate sales. Our successful trials put us in a position where we a poised for significant growth with the right investor providing both investment and support. 

 

 

 

eWaterPay uses mobile and contactless pay technology and IOT connectivity to ensure the transparent and accountable collection of user fees in order to fund the maintenance of water systems, with live dashboards showing how the taps are performing. Instant notification of faults in the system and information transfer via eWaterPay App notifies the local technician to ensure un-interrupted supply.
